I want to develop a mobile application (or digital platform) for my aesthetic and wellness clinic that supports a customizable membership and loyalty card system. The app should include a digital wallet, tiered benefits, and integration with Apple Wallet. Please help design the concept, features, user flow, and technical suggestions.

Core Idea:
Clients can purchase annual memberships that include a preloaded balance (like a treatment bank), exclusive discounts, welcome gifts, and access to VIP experiences. Their membership is represented by a digital card (Apple Wallet compatible) and an optional physical card.

Membership Tiers:
1. Silver Membership
– $12,000 MXN / $700 USD balance, valid for 12 months
– Welcome gift: 1 complimentary skincare product (based on skin type)
– 5% off all services
– 5% off non-medical retail products
– Access to exclusive member-only promotions
– 1 annual VIP event access

2. Gold Membership
– $20,000 MXN / $1,150 USD balance, valid for 12 months
– Welcome gifts:
  • 1 skincare product
  • 1 personalized facial treatment
– 10% off all services
– 10% off non-medical retail products
– Priority booking
– 2 annual VIP event accesses

3. Platinum Membership
– $30,000 MXN / $1,700 USD balance, valid for 12 months
– Welcome gifts:
  • 1 skincare product
  • 1 premium personalized facial
  • 1 laser facial (chosen from selected options)
– 15% off all services
– 15% off non-medical retail products
– Exclusive member-only promotions
– Priority booking
– Guaranteed invitation to all VIP events

Key App Features:
Digital Wallet: Clients can preload funds into their account (e.g., $1,000 deposit) and use that balance exclusively at the clinic. The app should show their current balance, transaction history, and expiration dates.

Apple Wallet + Google Wallet Integration: The digital card should be accessible from users' smartphones for easy scanning or check-in.

Membership Dashboard:
  • Tier level
  • Benefits overview
  • Discount eligibility
  • Balance tracking
  • Points earned (if a point system is added later)
  • Upcoming events or member promos

Staff/Admin Dashboard:
  • Load or deduct balances manually
  • Verify card codes
  • Track member activity
  • Issue invoices or receipts
  • Manage promotions, events, and usage limits

Technical Notes:
– Wallet funds are only usable within the clinic.
– Memberships are valid for 12 months and can be renewed up to 3 times per year.
– Funds are deducted as treatments/services are used.
– All services are eligible, unless otherwise specified.
– Physical cards should have a QR code or unique ID for scanning.
– Multi-language support (Spanish/English) is essential.
– Visual design should reflect luxury and wellness: clean, elegant, and user-friendly.
